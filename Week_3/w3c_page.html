<h1 id="about">About W3C</h1>
<p>Web inventor Tim Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium in 1994 to ensure the long-term growth of the Web.<br><br>

From the start the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) has been an international multi-stakeholder community where member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop open web standards.<br><br>

Led by Interim CEO Ralph Swick and a Board of Directors, the Web Consortium's mission is to lead the web to its full potential.</p>

<h2 id="community">W3C Community</h2>
<p>W3C's global standards constitute the toolkit for web solutions that scale, enabling innovators to solve hard problems, providing the proper foundations to meet requirements for accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security on the web.<br><br>
Standards that meet the varied needs of society are created not by one company but through the work of the Web Consortium community:<br><br>
Members: More than 400 Members from around the world lead the development and implementation of standards.<br><br>

Staff: W3C is a public-interest non-profit organization whose revenues come primarily from Membership dues. These and some grants support a staff of about 50 people.<br><br>
Developers: Over 12,000 developers worldwide participate in the standards development.</p>

<p>W3C has created Community and Business Groups to meet the needs of a growing community of Web stakeholders. Community Groups enable anyone to socialize their ideas for the Web at the W3C for possible future standardization. Business Groups provide companies anywhere in the world with access to the expertise and community needed to develop open Web technology. New W3C Working Groups can then build mature Web standards on top of best of the experimental work, and businesses and other organizations can make the most out of W3C’s Open Web Platform in their domain of interest.
W3C welcomes you to get involved in a group or propose your own. If your community is already up and running but you are interested in connecting with the international W3C community, you can start up a Community or Business Group and still maintain your external tools, provided that communications are also archived by W3C for intellectual property reasons.</p>

<p>Community Groups are designed to promote innovation and to lower barriers to individual participation. These groups are:</p>
<ul>
<li>OPEN TO ALL<br>
Anyone may participate</li>
<li>WITHOUT FEE<br>
No Membership is required</li>
<li>QUICK TO START<br>
No charter is required; just a short scope statement and a minimum number of supporters</li>
<li>PUBLIC<br>
Communications are publicly visible.</li>
<li>SELF-DETERMINED<br>
Group decision-making processes are self-determined, but required to be fair (e.g., to avoid anti-trust issues).</li>
<li>WITHOUT TIME LIMIT<br>
Communities may continue to work as long as they are functioning well; there is no chartered end date.</li>
<li>IPR BALANCED<br>
The IPR policies — intellectual property related to patents and copyrights — are designed to make it easy for IPR holders to join a group, to provide implementers with some IPR protection during development of a report, to create a final report that benefits from Royalty-Free licensing commitments, and to license contributions under a permissive copyright.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="development_process">W3C standard development process</h2>
<p>The proven standards development process upheld at the Web Consortium promotes fairness and enables progress.<br><br>

Our standards work is accomplished in the open, under the W3C Process Document and royalty-free W3C Patent Policy, with input from the broader community. Decisions are taken by consensus. Technical direction and Recommendations require review by W3C Members – large and small. The Advisory Board guides the community-driven enhancement of the Process Document. The Technical Architecture Group is our highest authority on technical matters.</p>

<p>Web development standards are a set of none static or evolving rules developed to promote and standardize the display of your website or application across all devices.
We all know that there are a variety of devices coming in different sizes with a growing selection of web browsers like Microsoft Internet Explorer, Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and others. We also know people use different operating systems such as Windows, Mac OS and Linux.
With all these possibilities, there is a high probability of your content, website or web application looking different in each of the devices, web browsers or operating systems. This means that if we wanted digital instances to work across different devices and configurations a standard was needed. It is possible to develop a website that does not comply with these standards but it is very likely that it will not be rendered properly by the different browsers and operating systems.
The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is the entity in charge of creating and maintaining web standards. W3C seeks to maximize web development to ensure consistency and quality around the web.
The most common items touched by W3C are for application and website design including standards for building and rendering web pages such us HTML, CSS, SVG, device IP’s and other technologies. We can also find standards for audio and video quality, privacy settings, mobile websites, accessibility and JavaScript. These web developments standards are not only limited to the most common devices such as laptops, mobile phones or tablets. They also regulate things like voice browsing, device independence, content adaptation, multimodal access, web and TV.
These web technologies standards were developed by thousands of members of the community that felt the need to build a consensus to promote improvement of high quality standards while at the same being aligned with fairness, responsiveness and progress in web technologies.</p>

<p>The process is very simple if you think there is an important subject to be discussed. You submit your request and a W3C team in search of signs of interest will analyze it, in some cases they will go as far as to do workshops to bring people together and discuss the topic. If W3C sees enough interest, the director will announce the development of a proposal for a new solution, then one or more groups will work on it.</p>

<p>There are three types of working participants: Member representatives, invited experts and team representatives.  Team representatives fund technical work and help to ensure the proper integration with W3C standards while other teams take care of the technicalities.</p>

<p>This process promotes global access and quality in technical decisions by acquiring the consensus sought after by the entire community. One of its most important factors to ensure the above is that not only W3C members review the process; the general public can review it as well to provide fairness across all scenarios.</p>

<h2 id="international_participation">International Participation</h2>
<p>W3C conducts its work primarily in English. Organizations located all over the world and involved in many different fields join W3C as Members to participate in a vendor-neutral forum for the creation of Web standards. W3C Members and a dedicated full-time staff of experts have earned W3C international recognition for contributions to the Web. W3C's global efforts include:<br><br>

Liaisons with national, regional and international organizations around the globe. These contacts help W3C maintain a culture of global participation in the development of the World Wide Web. W3C coordinates particularly closely with other organizations that are developing standards for the Web or Internet in order to enable clear progress.<br><br>

The W3C Chapters Program, which promotes adoption of W3C recommendations among developers, application builders, and standards setters, and encourage inclusions of stakeholder organizations in the creation of future standards by joining W3C.<br><br>

Translations of Web standards and other materials from dedicated volunteers in the W3C community. W3C also has a policy for authorized translations of W3C materials. Authorized W3C Translations can be used for official purposes in languages other than English.<br><br>

Talks around the world in a variety of languages on Web standards by people closely involved in the creation of the standards.<br><br>
W3C's Internationalization activity helps ensure that the Web is available to people.</p>

<p>The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was founded in 1994 by Tim Berners-Lee after he left the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) in October 1994.[4] It was founded at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) Laboratory for Computer Science with support from the European Commission, and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, which had pioneered the ARPANET, one of the predecessors to the Internet.[3] It was located in Technology Square until 2004, when it moved, with the MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, to the Stata Center.[5]</p>



<h2 id="recognition">Recognition</h2>
<p>In orchestrating these activities, the Web Consortium has earned a reputation for fairness, quality, and efficiency.<br><br>

Though not well-known by the general public, the Web Consortium has earned recognition for its global impact: the Boston Globe ranked W3C the most important achievement associated with MIT (the first W3C historical Host).<br><br>

The Web Consortium's impact even extends beyond this planet: NASA regularly uses W3C standards in Mars and space exploration missions.<br><br>

The organization has won three Emmy Awards: in 2016 for its work to make online videos more accessible with captions and subtitles, in 2019 for standardization of a Full TV Experience on the web, and again in 2022 for standardizing font technology for custom downloadable fonts and typography for web and TV devices.</p>

<p>The organization tries to foster compatibility and agreement among industry members in the adoption of new standards defined by the W3C. Incompatible versions of HTML are offered by different vendors, causing inconsistency in how web pages are displayed. The consortium tries to get all those vendors to implement a set of core principles and components that are chosen by the consortium.

It was originally intended that CERN host the European branch of W3C; however, CERN wished to focus on particle physics, not information technology. In April 1995, the French Institute for Research in Computer Science and Automation became the European host of W3C, with Keio University Research Institute at SFC becoming the Asian host in September 1996.[6] Starting in 1997, W3C created regional offices around the world. As of September 2009, it had eighteen World Offices covering Australia, the Benelux countries (Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg), Brazil, China, Finland, Germany, Austria, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Israel, Italy, South Korea, Morocco, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, and, as of 2016, the United Kingdom and Ireland.[7]</p>

<p>The Consortium is governed by its membership. The list of members is available to the public.[2] Members include businesses, nonprofit organizations, universities, governmental entities, and individuals.[21]</p>

<p>Membership requirements are transparent except for one requirement: An application for membership must be reviewed and approved by the W3C. Many guidelines and requirements are stated in detail, but there is no final guideline about the process or standards by which membership might be finally approved or denied.[22]</p>


<p>The cost of membership is given on a sliding scale, depending on the character of the organization applying and the country in which it is located.[23] Countries are categorized by the World Bank's most recent grouping by gross national income per capita.[24]</p>

<h2 id="organizational_structure">Organizational Structure</h2>
<p>In administrative terms W3C has become its own legal entity since January 2023, moving to a public-interest non-profit organization after 28 years with an atypical organizational structure where legal and fiduciary roles were assumed by four host institutions across the planet. Read more about the W3C history.</p>

<p>In process terms, the W3C Process Document, Member Agreement, Patent Policy, and a few others documents establish the roles and responsibilities of the parties involved in the making of W3C standards.</p>

<p>The Process governs the standards-setting aspect of W3C. The Bylaws govern the operation of the corporation that supports the standards process and W3C’s other efforts to pursue its mission.</p>

<p>W3C develops technical specifications for HTML5, CSS, SVG, WOFF, the Semantic Web stack, XML, and other technologies.[12] Sometimes, when a specification becomes too large, it is split into independent modules that can mature at their own pace. Subsequent editions of a module or specification are known as levels and are denoted by the first integer in the title (e.g. CSS3 = Level 3). Subsequent revisions on each level are denoted by an integer following a decimal point (for example, CSS2.1 = Revision 1).
The W3C standard formation process is defined within the W3C process document, outlining four maturity levels through which each new standard or recommendation must progress.[13]</p>
